## Expressions representation
### Mathematical representation
What is an expression? Well, matematicians and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(mathematics)) would say:
> In mathematics, an expression or mathematical expression is a finite combination of symbols that is well-formed according to rules that depend on the context. Mathematical symbols can designate numbers (constants), variables, operations, functions, brackets, punctuation, and grouping to help determine order of operations, and other aspects of logical syntax.

In a more [siplified math](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/expression.html) language and with less things to worry about, it can be defined as:
> Numbers, symbols and operators (such as + and Ã—) grouped together that show the value of something.

Greater, huh? Now back to computers...
### Computer science representation
Well, let's see an example, not just story telling:

Computers don't like this, so we'll translate it for it: `(1+1)*13+10/2`

Is this enough? Not really. Computers just do `01010111001111`. Here come the programming languages. A programming language is capable of translating such expression into `01010111001111`. We'll study this in C++, so we'll call this compilation.
